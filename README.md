## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom variables
- Flexbox
- Javascript for that JSON though

### Continued development

- I really wanted to use Thymeleaf to iterate through the json file; I was really comfortable with Thymeleaf during winter of 2021. If you don't use it, you could lose it.
- SASS, I spent too much time refactoring & restarting my js script
- Mobile-first workflow
- Properly implementing an external source, such as a JavaScript Library


### Useful resources

- [This Solution](https://github.com/Vaib215/Expenses-Chart-Component) - had the easiest JavaScript function to follow without using an external source to create the bar chart, I found it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfbeDrcchNc)
- [Another Solution](https://github.com/JonKohJJ/Expenses-Chart-Component) - used an async function that I want to try out
- [This CodePen](https://codepen.io/davidelrizzo/full/dGBpZK/) - is a great example of Table Markup Best Practice
- [Plotly Examples](https://plotly.com/javascript/bar-charts/#bar-chart-with-hover-text) - I am trying to use this JS Library 
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)I'm also trying this one because I love to torture myself
- [Charts.css](https://chartscss.org/) This was recomended by the leader of the Code Challenges, so I should've tried it instead

## Acknowledgments

As always, I will tip my hat to the Code Challenges Team at VMLY&R for hosting, inviting me, & participating in these sessions based on a Frontend Mentor Challenge we vote on. It's literally the best "team building" exercise possible!
