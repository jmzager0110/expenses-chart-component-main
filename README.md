## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom variables
- Too. Many. Divs?
- Javascript for that JSON though

### What I learned

- Most proud of my continued development in Javascript
- Least proud of the amount of divs in my index file

### Continued development

- I really wanted to use Thymeleaf to iterate within the heml file easily & simply; I was really comfortable with Thymeleaf during winter of 2021. If you don't use it, you could lose it.
- SASS, I spent too much time refactoring & restarting my js script
- Mobile-first workflow


### Useful resources

- [This Solution](https://github.com/gdsimoes/expenses-chart-component) has a really simple solution to highlighting the current day
- [Another Solution](https://github.com/JonKohJJ/Expenses-Chart-Component) helped me figure out asynchronious functions
- [Yet Another Solution](https://github.com/sumyat-aung/expenses-chart-component) - is described as responsive
- [This CodePen](https://codepen.io/davidelrizzo/full/dGBpZK/) - is a great example of Table Markup Best Practice
- [Another Solution](Expenses-chart-component---Frontend-Mentor) - uses a custom table 
- [This solution](https://github.com/CarolineLienard/Expenses-Chart-Component) - uses a js method "createElement" to display the bars within the chart
- [Plotly Examples](https://plotly.com/javascript/bar-charts/#bar-chart-with-hover-text) - I decided to use this js library to at least have a "boiler plate" chart
