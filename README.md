## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current dayâ€™s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their deviceâ€™s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom variables
- Flexbox/Tables/Grid
- Javascript for that JSON though


**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

- I really wanted to use Thymeleaf to iterate through the json file; I was really comfortable with Thymeleaf during winter of 2021. If you don't use it, you could lose it.
- SASS, I spent too much time refactoring & restarting my js script
- Mobile-first workflow


### Useful resources

- [This Solution](https://github.com/dheysonalves/expenses-chart-component) - was interesting because it has no js file at all, their script is just within their index file, no hover state though
- [Another Solution](https://github.com/JonKohJJ/Expenses-Chart-Component) - used an async function in their js file and only divs in their index file
- [Yet Another Solution](https://github.com/sumyat-aung/expenses-chart-component) - is described as responsive
- [This CodePen](https://codepen.io/davidelrizzo/full/dGBpZK/) - is a great example of Table Markup Best Practice
- [Another Solution](Expenses-chart-component---Frontend-Mentor) - uses a custom table 
- [This solution](https://github.com/CarolineLienard/Expenses-Chart-Component) - uses a js method "createElement" to display the bars within the chart
- [Plotly Examples](https://plotly.com/javascript/bar-charts/#bar-chart-with-hover-text) - I decided to use this js library to at least have a "boiler plate" chart

As always, I will tip my hat to the Code Challenges Team at VMLY&R for hosting, inviting me, & participating in these sessions based on a Frontend Mentor Challenge we vote on. It's literally the best "team building" exercise possible!
