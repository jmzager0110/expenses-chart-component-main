## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom variables
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Too. Many. Divs?
- Javascript for that JSON though

### What I learned

- Most proud of my continued development in Javascript
- Least proud of the amount of divs in my index file

=======
- Flexbox
- Javascript for that JSON though

### Continued development

- I really wanted to use Thymeleaf to iterate within the heml file easily & simply; I was really comfortable with Thymeleaf during winter of 2021. If you don't use it, you could lose it.
- SASS, I spent too much time refactoring & restarting my js script
- Mobile-first workflow
- Properly implementing an external source, such as a JavaScript Library


### Useful resources

<<<<<<< HEAD
- [This Solution](https://github.com/gdsimoes/expenses-chart-component) has a really simple solution to highlighting the current day
- [Another Solution](https://github.com/JonKohJJ/Expenses-Chart-Component) helped me figure out asynchronious functions
- [Yet Another Solution](https://github.com/sumyat-aung/expenses-chart-component) - is described as responsive
=======
- [This Solution](https://github.com/Vaib215/Expenses-Chart-Component) - had the easiest JavaScript function to follow without using an external source to create the bar chart, I found it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfbeDrcchNc)
- [Another Solution](https://github.com/JonKohJJ/Expenses-Chart-Component) - used an async function that I want to try out

- [This CodePen](https://codepen.io/davidelrizzo/full/dGBpZK/) - is a great example of Table Markup Best Practice
- [Plotly Examples](https://plotly.com/javascript/bar-charts/#bar-chart-with-hover-text) - I am trying to use this JS Library 
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)I'm also trying this one because I love to torture myself
- [Charts.css](https://chartscss.org/) This was recomended by the leader of the Code Challenges, so I should've tried it instead
